#Days between dates calculator 
a program that takes in 2 dates and calculates the number of days between them.

## How to use it:
the main function `days_between_dates` takes in 6 arguments `(day1, month1, year1, day2, month2, year2)` and returns the number of days between the two dates, where: **day1, month1, year1** is the **older** date and **day2, month2, year2** is the **later** date.

### Example:
to print the number of days between:  march 8th 2004 and march 8th 2005 you should run:
```
print days_between_dates(8,3,2004,8,3,2005)

```
this will print
